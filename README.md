# Varde

This is an experiment to make a tool to make it possible to add annotations to
a website in the form of different tags.

This should be possible:

  1. Add tags that a site can be annotated with
  2. See existing tags that a site uses
  3. Add a number of tags to a site
  4. See who has added tags to a site

## Development

- `npm install`
- To build `dist/main.js` run `npm run build`
- To test plugin in browser do `cd dist`, and `npx web-ext run`
